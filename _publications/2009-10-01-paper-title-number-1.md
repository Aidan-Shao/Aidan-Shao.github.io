This study delves into the lifecycle of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) using single-cell RNA sequencing data from nine lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). While most cells were in the latent phase, two distinct clusters emerged, characterized by the high expression of EBV genes LMP1/BNLF2 and BZLF1. These clusters differed in their expression of the lytic gene GP350. The GP350–LMP1hi cluster, regulated by HIF1-α, was inducible by Pevonedistat, while the GP350+LMP1hi cluster showed low expression of super-enhancer-regulated host genes like MYC and IRF4. Perturbing these super-enhancers triggered lytic EBV gene expression, highlighting their role in maintaining EBV latency. This work uncovers significant EBV-associated heterogeneity among LCLs, with potential implications for both viral and host biology.

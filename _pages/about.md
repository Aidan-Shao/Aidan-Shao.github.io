Hi, I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate study in Immunology and Computational Biology in Purdue University, West Lafayette. 
I love playing badminton and fly fishing.
Iâ€™m working in [Dr.Qing Deng's Lab](https://www.denglab.us/research) and co-adviosred by [Dr.Xiaoping Bao's Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/xiaoping-bao/research). Cell and gene therapies hold great promise to treat a number of cancers and inherited genetic disorders, including leukemia, Cancer, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), etc. Right now, the remarkable potential of neutrophil engineering for targeted therapies is exciting.Our lab integrates computational and high throughput experimental approaches (e.g., scRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq) to identify novel pathways, new biomarkers, gene evolution, and function during human development and diseases. By using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to differentiate into neutrophils or other immune cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), we aim to expand the existing repertoire of immunotherapy tools. Additionally, we are leveraging advanced machine learning models and AI-driven approaches to screen for the most effective CAR structures tailored specifically for neutrophils. These efforts represent our commitment to integrating AI for scientific discovery, enhancing the precision and efficacy of targeted therapies in the fight against complex diseases.

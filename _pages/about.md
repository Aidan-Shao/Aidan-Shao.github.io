Hi, I'm currently an undergraduate student majoring in biological engineering in Purdue University, West Lafayette. 
I love play badminton and fly fishing.
Iâ€™m also an undergraduate researcher in Dr.Kazemian Majid's Lab. We are interested in studying underlying mechanism of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes and asthma and infections including hepatitis and Epstein-Barr viruses leading to cancer. 
Our lab integrates computational and high throughput experimental approaches (e.g. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, Hi-C) in to identify novel pathways, new host-pathogen interactions and regulatory noncoding RNAs (e.g. enhancer RNAs and circular RNAs) that could trigger disease.

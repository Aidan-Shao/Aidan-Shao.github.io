Hi, I'm currently a Ph.D. student study in Immunology and system biology in Purdue University, West Lafayette. 
I love play badminton and fly fishing.
Iâ€™m working in [Dr.Qing Deng's Lab](https://www.denglab.us/research) and co-adviosred by [Dr.Xiaoping Bao's Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/xiaoping-bao/research). Cell and gene therapies hold great promise to treat a number of cancers and inherited genetic disorders, including leukemia, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), etc. Right now, the remarkable potential of neutrophil engineering for targeted therapies is exciting. Our lab integrates computational and high throughput experimental approaches (e.g. scRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, Hi-C) in to identify novel pathways, new biomarkers, gene evolution and function during human development and diseases. By using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to differentiate into neutrophils or NK cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), we can expand the existing repertoire of immunotherapy tools and pave the way for future developments in immunotherapy.
